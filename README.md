## Lab 1 _Initialize State Variable_
you have to create a public state variable num and initialized it with 10;

## Lab 2 _Get Local Variable_
you have to create a local variable rollNumber and initialized it with 10 using a function getLocal() . This getLocal( ) also returns the value the local variable.

## Lab 3 _Creating Functions_
you have to create a state variable and initialised it with 10 and then you have to create a function returnStateVariable( ) which returns the value of the created state variable .
In the same way you have to create a local variable and initialised it with 20 and then you have to create a function returnLocalVariable( ) which returns the value of the created local variable.

## Lab 4 _Arguments In Function_

1.Create a state variable (need not to be public).
2.Create a set() and with one argument. And set the value of the created state variable with the value passed as an argument to the set().
3.Then create another function get() which returns the value of the state variable.
