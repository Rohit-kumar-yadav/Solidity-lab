## Lab 1 _Initialize State Variable_
`To complete this challenge, you have to create a public state variable num and initialized it with 10;`

## Lab 2 _Get Local Variable_
`To complete this challenge, you have to create a local variable rollNumber and initialized it with 10 using a function getLocal() . This getLocal( ) also returns the value the local variable.`

## Lab 3 _Creating Functions_
`To complete this challenge, you have to create a state variable and initialised it with 10 and then you have to create a function returnStateVariable( ) which returns the value of the created state variable .
In the same way you have to create a local variable and initialised it with 20 and then you have to create a function returnLocalVariable( ) which returns the value of the created local variable.`
